# Rock-paper-scissors-game
The user plays 3 rounds of rock paper scissors with the computer. 
The adversary randomly chooses a different option each round.
Each round, after the player made their choice, the script will compare the player's pick with the choice of their adversary. If the player is victorious, they get a point.
When the game finishes, the score will be displayed and if the player won/lost.

I wrote this script to further practice using the random module in Python.
